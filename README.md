# metro-fare-calculator

Metro Fare Calculator is a simple web application designed to help users calculate the fare for their metro rides. With this application, users can easily determine the cost of their metro ride based on their starting and ending stations.



The application is built using the Django framework and is designed to be responsive and easy to use. Users simply select their starting station and ending station from a dropdown menu, and the application calculates the fare based on the distance between the two stations.

I have created CI/CD pipelines to automatically deploy code updates on Github repository to pythonanywhere web application. 

Automating Code Deployment from GitHub to PythonAnywhere

Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide to automatically deploy code updates from a GitHub repository to a PythonAnywhere web application using GitHub Actions and the PythonAnywhere API.

1. Prerequisites

Before setting up automation, ensure you have:

A PythonAnywhere account (Free or Paid)

A GitHub repository with your project

API access enabled on PythonAnywhere (for Free users)

A web app running on PythonAnywhere

2. Enable API Access on PythonAnywhere

To use the PythonAnywhere API:

Go to PythonAnywhere Account Settings

Scroll to API Token and click "Create API Token" (if not already created).

Copy the API Token, as it will be needed later.

3. Clone Your GitHub Repository on PythonAnywhere

Open the Bash console on PythonAnywhere.

Run the following command to clone your repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

Navigate to your project directory:

cd yourrepository

4. Automate Deployment Using GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will automatically update your PythonAnywhere code whenever you push changes.

Step 1: Add API Token as a GitHub Secret

Go to your GitHub repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions

Click "New Repository Secret"

Add the API Token:

Name: PA_API_TOKEN

Value: Paste your PythonAnywhere API token

Click "Save".

Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

In your GitHub repository, create a file:
ðŸ“„ .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy to PythonAnywhere

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Update code on PythonAnywhere
      run: |
        curl -s -X POST \
        "https://www.pythonanywhere.com/api/v0/user/${{ secrets.PA_USERNAME }}/consoles/38366532/send_input/" \
        -H "Authorization: Token ${{ secrets.PA_API_TOKEN }}" \
        -d '{"input": "git pull origin master\n"}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"

    - name: Reload PythonAnywhere Web App
      run: |
        curl -s -X POST \
        "https://www.pythonanywhere.com/api/v0/user/${{ secrets.PA_USERNAME }}/webapps/${{ secrets.PA_USERNAME }}.pythonanywhere.com/reload/" \
        -H "Authorization: Token ${{ secrets.PA_API_TOKEN }}" 
        
Step 3: Modify the Workflow File

Replace your_username with your PythonAnywhere username.

Replace yourrepository with your GitHub repository name.

Replace your_console_id (Find it by listing consoles via API: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/api/v0/user/your_username/consoles/).

Ensure the correct branch (main) is specified in the workflow.

5. Testing the Deployment

Push a change to your GitHub repository.

Go to GitHub â†’ Actions and verify the workflow execution.

If successful, check your PythonAnywhere project for the updated code.

The web app will automatically reload after deployment.

6. Manual Deployment (If Needed)

If GitHub Actions is not used, you can manually pull updates:

cd yourrepository
git pull origin main

To reload the web app manually:

touch /var/www/your_username_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py

7. Troubleshooting

Issue

Solution

Authentication error

Ensure the API token is correctly added in GitHub Secrets.

Changes not reflecting

Verify git pull works in the PythonAnywhere console.

Console ID issue

Use API to list active consoles and find the correct console_id.

Conclusion

This guide helps automate deployment from GitHub to PythonAnywhere using API calls. Once set up, every push to GitHub updates the PythonAnywhere project automatically and reloads the web app. ðŸš€

If you are looking for a reliable and user-friendly metro fare calculator, this project is an excellent choice. It is free and open-source, so feel free to fork the repository and make contributions to improve the application further.

1. Install Python: If you haven't already, download and install the latest version of Python for your operating system from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Git: Download and install Git for your operating system from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

3. Clone the project: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command to clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

4. Replace the username with the username of the person who created the project and the project with the name of the project.

5. Install virtualenv: Virtualenv is a tool that allows you to create isolated Python environments for each project, so you don't have to worry about dependencies conflicting with each other. To install virtualenv, run the following command:

pip install virtualenv

6. Create a virtual environment: Navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment by running the following command:

virtualenv env

7. Activate the virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

For Windows:

env\Scripts\activate

For macOS or Linux:

source env/bin/activate

8. Install dependencies: Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

9. Set up the database: Before you can run the Django project, you need to set up the database. Run the following commands in order:

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

10.Run the server: Finally, run the Django server by running the following command:

python manage.py runserver

This should start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/.

Nice work
